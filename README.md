# Knight-s-Tour-Problem

This program solves the Knight's Tour Problem.
Given a position on the chessboard, the program finds out if there is a sequence of moves, for a knight, that starts in tht position and covers the whole chessboard.

- Sequences can be encoded (compressed into binary files with a specific format), and can be saved.
- Sequences can be decoded (dempressed from that same binary file fromat), and can be loaded.
